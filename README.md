# The Clojure Standard Library - Chapter 10 - Mandelbrot Set example


![The mandelbrot set with the real axis from -2.25 to 0.75 and the imaginary axis from -1 to 1](https://github.com/rachbowyer/csl-10-vector-public/blob/master/mandelbrot-set.png)


This is an extended version of the code in [The Clojure Standard Library](https://www.manning.com/books/clojure-standard-library) Chapter 10 - Vectors, 
which produces the beautifully rendered image of the Mandelbrot Set (shown above) using the [Quill](http://quil.info/) library.

To build and run the code:

     lein uberjar
     java -jar target/uberjar/csl-10-vector-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
